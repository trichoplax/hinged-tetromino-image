# hinged-tetromino-image
An SVG image of the 22 hinged tetrominoes (and an SVG image of the 5 standard tetrominoes for comparison).

The colours used came from an academic paper about accessible colour palettes, that was previously available at http://jfly.iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp/color/#select but seems to have disappeared.
