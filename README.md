Some SVG images for explanation of hinged tetrominoes.
- An image of the 22 hinged tetrominoes
- An image of the 5 standard tetrominoes for comparison
- An image of 1 hinged tetromino in 8 different orientations to illustrate equivalence under rotation, reflection, and translation

The colours used came from an academic paper about accessible colour palettes, that was previously available at http://jfly.iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp/color/#select but seems to have disappeared.
